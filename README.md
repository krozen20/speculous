=========

Lightweight, simple BDD style of testing in .NET. Sits on top of your favorite xUnit framework. RSpec inspired.

This project is sort of "scratch your own itch". What I don't like about other framework is they try too hard to mimic RSpec behavior. This project aims to combine the simplicity of RSpec and C# idioms and practices.
